# Hand Gesture Recognition with Mediapipe and PyTorch

This repository implements a hand gesture recognition system using Python, Mediapipe, and PyTorch. The system detects and classifies hand gestures in real-time, making it suitable for applications like sign language recognition, gesture-based control systems, and interactive applications.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection using Mediapipe.
- Gesture classification with a PyTorch-based neural network.
- Easy-to-extend codebase for adding more gestures or fine-tuning models.
- Supports live video input and pre-recorded video files.
